# Titanic Survival Prediction<br>
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic disaster. The model uses the popular Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers such as their age, fare, and class, among other factors.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Jupyter Notebook<br>
Python 3<br>
Required Python packages (such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn)<br>

# Usage
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:<br>

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.<br>
Open the Jupyter Notebook file titanic.ipynb.<br>
Run the code cells in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.<br>
The final cells of the notebook will show the model's accuracy in predicting the survival of Titanic passengers<b>.

# Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the Kaggle Titanic challenge and was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle.
